					<h2>Design System</h2>
					<h4>Karen Umeda</h4>
					<p>This is my design system featuring peachy color palette and Work Sans type.</p>
					<p>Work Sans is a free, open-source typeface designed by Australian type designer Wei Huang. It was commissioned by Google Fonts and released in 2015. This style of sans-serif influenced by early grotesques is quite popular at the moment, so I’m predicting that we’ll start to see Work Sans used all over the web in the coming months.</p>

				<p>Buttons should be rounded and they should be secondary colors. If needed, the accent color would work as well.

				<p>Use 40-60 symbols in a line of text. All font sizes are defined in the guide — you need only follow the guide. Provide enough space between paragraphs</p>
				<h4>Spacings</h4>
				<p>8pt
				All spacing we use are the multiple of 8: 8 / 16 / 24 / 32 / 40 / 48 /... 8*n.

				You can use 4 on a very exceptional basis. The spacings have their logic — two unrelated things must be far away. Layouts need to breathe. The bigger the object, the bigger the space around it.</p>
